# Higgs-Boson-ML

Higgs Boson Machine Learning Kaggle competition as part of the course of Statistical Learning of the Big Data Certificate at UPMC Paris (M2 of Mathematics). Course given by Olivier Schwander and Patrick Gallinari. 

The notebook holds all the code for this project and is commented in consequence. It was implemented in Python, in a quick and dirty approach. The use of OOP, classes and clear separate .py files would have been certainly more appropriate though, but we did not have much time to complete the project.
The PDF report, written in English, provides a more detailed summary of the work that has been done.
